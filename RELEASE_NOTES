Version 1.6.4 - March 2012
==========================
This release is based on Go 1.

appengine:
  ! Remove the AppID method on Context.
  - Add MultiError type.
  - Add InstanceID, Datacenter and ServerSoftware functions.
appengine/datastore:
  - Add cursors.
  - Add AllocateIDs function.
  - Allow (*datastore.Key)(nil) as a storable value.
  - Allow GetMulti, PutMulti and GetAll to take PropertyLoadSavers, not just
    structs. Their slice argument can now be a []T, not just a []interface{}.
  - Allow Iterator.Next to take a nil destination for all queries, not just
    keys-only queries.
  ! Make queries immutable. Query methods like Filter and Order return a new
    value instead of modifying the receiver. Use an assignment such as
    "q = q.Offset(1)" instead of a bare statement like "q.Offset(1)".
  ! Change the meaning of Query.Limit(0) from "unlimited" to "no results" and
    change the meaning of Query.Limit(-1) from being an error to "unlimited".
    Unlimited is still the default behavior.
  ! Remove datastore.Time in favour of time.Time.
  ! Remove the deprecated Map type. Use a PropertyList instead.
  ! Rename Eq method of Key to Equal.
appengine/log:
  ! Convert to using time.Duration and time.Time throughout.
appengine/mail:
  - Support HTML mail.
appengine/memcache:
  ! Change Item.Expiration's type from int32 seconds to time.Duration.
    (Code may still compile, but will likely be wrong, expiring
     items immediately, interpreting seconds as nanoseconds)
  ! Make functions uniformly return error, using appengine.MultiError
    for batch operations.
appengine/taskqueue:
  ! Rename LeaseTasks, LeaseTasksByTag and ModifyTaskLease to
    Lease, LeaseByTag and ModifyLease respectively.
  ! Convert to using time.Duration and time.Time throughout.
appengine/urlfetch:
  ! Change Transport.DeadlineSeconds's type from float64 to time.Duration,
    and rename it to Deadline.
appengine/user:
  ! Rename Id field of User struct to ID.
appengine/xmpp
  ! Remove ChatHandler, and rename RegisterChatHandler to Handle.
  ! Remove SendMessageError. Use appengine.MultiError instead.
